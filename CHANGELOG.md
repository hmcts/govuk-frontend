# Changelog

Note: We're not following semantic versioning yet, we are going to talk about this soon.

## Unreleased

üí• Breaking changes:

- The `govuk-file-url` helper has been renamed to to `govuk-image-url`. If you
  are using this function in your own styles you will need to update calls to
  it. ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- The `$govuk-global-images` variable has been renamed to to
  `$govuk-images-path`. If you are overriding this variable or using it in your
  own styles you will need to update your code to use the new variable name.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))


üîß Fixes:

- Namespacing SCSS exports with 'govuk-' prefix to avoid clashes with
  exports in applications consuming GOV.UK Frontend
  ([PR #732](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/732))

- Fixes a bug whereby print styles were being 'rasterized' into the screen
  styles when generating the IE8 stylesheet (this is a bug in sass-mq, and has
  also been raised upstream ‚Äì https://github.com/sass-mq/sass-mq/pull/111).
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- Removed some duplicated CSS rules from the outputted CSS
  ([PR #727](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/727))


üÜï New features:

- Change font delivery method from Base64 encoded strings to serving WOFF2, WOFF
  and EOT files as separate HTTP requests. You will need to ensure that you are
  serving the fonts from the assets folder as part of your application.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))

- The font-face is now using `font-display: fallback`. This means that the
  fallback font (Arial) will be used if NTA doesn't download within 100ms. The
  browser will then swap to NTA as long as it loads within the short swap period.
  ([PR #726](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/726))


üè† Internal:

  ([PR #720](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/720))

## 0.0.29-alpha (Breaking release)

üí• Breaking changes:

- Restructure project to enable it to be published as a single package

  The [new project structure]((./src/README.md)) matches our ITCSS inspired layers and is published as a single package as `@govuk-frontend/frontend`.

  You will need to:

  - Update your npm dependencies to use `@govuk-frontend/frontend`
  - Update your SCSS import paths to match the new package name and folder structure.

  If you're importing everything at once:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/all";
  ```

  If you're importing individual components:

  ```CSS
  @import "node_modules/@govuk-frontend/frontend/components/button/button";
  ```

  See the [main README](./README.md) for up-to-date installation instructions.

  ([PR #680](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/680))

- Error Messages and Hints have been moved out Label and Fieldset components.

  They are no longer nested within the label or legend.
  They are associated with the input or with the fieldset using aria-describedby.

  Hint has been made into a new component similar to Error Message.

  If you're using markup, you will need to update the old markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-c-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
    <span class="govuk-c-label__hint">
      It‚Äôs on your National Insurance card, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‚ÄòQQ 12 34 56 C‚Äô.
    </span>
    <span class="govuk-c-error-message">
      Error message goes here
    </span>
  </label>
  <input class="govuk-c-input govuk-c-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="national-insurance-number" type="text">
  ```

  With the new markup:

  ```HTML
  <label class="govuk-label" for="national-insurance-number">
    National Insurance number
  </label>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-hint" class="govuk-hint">
    It‚Äôs on your <i>National Insurance card</i>, benefit letter, payslip or P60. For example, ‚ÄòQQ 12 34 56 C‚Äô.
  </span>
  <span id="national-insurance-number-error" class="govuk-error-message">
    Error message goes here
  </span>
  <input class="govuk-input govuk-input--error" id="national-insurance-number" name="test-name-3" type="text" aria-describedby="national-insurance-number-hint national-insurance-number-error">
  ```

  If you're using macros:

  The fieldset macro no longer accepts `legendHintText` or `legendHintHtml` -
  these parameters are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or
  `html`. The date-input, checkboxes and radios components have been updated to
  use the new Hint component.

  The label macro no longer accepts `hintText` or `hintHtml` - these parameters
  are now passed to the hint component which accepts `text` or `html`. The
  file-upload, input, select and textarea components have been updated to use the
  new Hint component.

  For example, this example macro call for a File Upload component:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo",
      "hintText": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```njk
  {{ govukFileUpload({
    "id": "file-upload",
    "name": "photo",
    "label": {
      "text": "Upload your photo"
    },
    "hint": {
      "text": "Your photo may be in your Pictures, Photos, Downloads or Desktop folder."
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  For more examples of the new markup and Nunjucks macros see the GOV.UK Design System [Question Pages pattern](https://govuk-design-system-production.cloudapps.digital/patterns/question-pages/)

  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The date-input component now sets an explicit `group` role on the fieldset
  to force JAWS 18 to announce the error message and hint.
  ([PR #681](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/681))

- The label component macro now accepts an `isPageHeading` argument which determines
  whether the label itself should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <h1 class="govuk-label-wrapper">
    <label class="govuk-label">What is your National Insurance number?</label>
  </h1>
  ```

  The `.govuk-label-wrapper` removes the margins from the heading so that the
  presence of the `h1` has no effect on the styling of the label.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for labels to allow you to create a label that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-label--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The arguments for a fieldset's legend have been rolled up into an object. For
  example, the following macro call:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legendText: "What is your date of birth?"
  }) }}
  ```

  would now be:

  ```
  {{ govukFieldset({
    legend: {
      text: "What is your date of birth?"
    }
  }) }}
  ```

  The `legend` object can also accept new `classes` and `arguments`

  Components that use the fieldset component have been updated to reflect these
  changes.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- The fieldset component has a new parameter legend.isPageHeading, which defines
  whether the legend text should be wrapped in an h1:

  ```html
  <legend class="govuk-fieldset__legend">
    <h1 class="govuk-fieldset__heading">Have you changed your name?</h1>
  </legend>
  ```

  The `.govuk-fieldset__heading` class ensures that the `<h1>` inherits its
  properties from the legend, so that the presence of the `h1` has no effect on
  its styling.

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))


- Added new modifier classes for legends to allow you to create a legend that
  visually corresponds to the equivalent heading class (for example, a
  `.govuk-fieldset__legend--xl` will have the same font size and weight as a
  `.govuk-heading-xl`)

  ([PR #684](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/684))

- Remove -c -o -h layer prefixes
  ([PR #644](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/644))
  In user research and in feedback from Private Beta partners we
  learned that users didn't really understand what -o, -c and -h prefixes
  stand for or why they're useful.

  They also introduced additional cognitive load when composing classes,
  having to remember which suffix the classname contains.

  If you're using markup, you will need to:
  - Remove -o, -c and -h prefixes from class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-c-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <button class="govuk-button">Save and continue</button>
  ```

- Simplify grid syntax and introduce grid-row and column mixins.

  Based on user research feedback we have simplified the grid classes
  to a more concise naming structure.

  You will need to:
  - Change grid class names in your markup

  For example, change:
  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-o-grid">
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-o-grid__item govuk-o-grid__item--one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  Into:

  ```HTML
  <div class="govuk-grid-row">
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
    <div class="govuk-grid-column-one-third">
      <!-- content -->
    </div>
  </div>
  ```

  We have also introduced two mixins
  to help generate additional or custom grid styles and widths,
  see original pull request for usage.

  ([PR #665](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/665))


üîß Fixes:

- Opt-in Global `<a>` and `<p>` styles
  (PR [#658](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/658))

  Global styles are not included by default.

  This is to avoid the risk of these globals conflicting with any pre-existing globals, for example in GOV.UK Elements or GOV.UK Template.

  Hovever, we do include them in the [GOV.UK Prototype Kit](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-prototype-kit-private-beta) to speed up prototyping.

  To include global styles, you can set `$govuk-global-styles` variable to `true`.

  details.
  (PR [#631](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/631))
- Rename captionSize table argument to captionClasses ([PR #643](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/643))

üîß Fixes:
- Link styles, as well as links within the  back-link, breadcrumbs, button,
  error summary, footer and skip link components defend against the
  `a:link:focus` selector in GOV.UK Template, which was overriding focussed
  links to always use the dark blue link colour for text.
  (PR [#609](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/609))

- The back link, breadcrumbs and skip link have been updated to use the
  text style link mixin
  (PR [#609](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/609))

  a transparent border which is visible when overriding colours in the browser
  (PR [#552](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/552))
- Redundant duplication on the start button variant has been removed as it is
  inherited from the main .govuk-c-button class

  (PR [#551](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/551))

üè† Internal:

- The 'prose scope' has been updated to extend only placeholder classes. The
  corresponding classes the prose scope extends have been updated to provide a
  placeholder class and separately create the concrete class. This allows us
  to be specific about which occurrences of the class are meant to be extended.
  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))
- The sass-lint config has been updated to prevent the use of `@extend` with
  concrete classes.
  (PR [#550](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend/pull/550))
